			In the summer of 2008, I created a website for <a
				href="http://www.kustomjoes.com">Kustom Joe's</a> paint and auto
			body shop. The site is hosted on Google's App Engine. My favorite
			thing about this site is its speed! There is only one html file that
			contains all the pages on the site. Javascript is used to transfer a
			user to a page without having to contact the server to download a new
			page. Consequently, when the user displays the home page all other
			pages are loaded as well, which allows quick navigation between
			pages.
		</p>
		<p>Another unique feature is the gallery, which allows customers
			to view images of the work done by Kustom Joe's. The gallery uses
			Google's Picassa Web Albums to allow the owner of Kustom Joe's to
			control the images displayed on the website.</p>
		<p>
			The website for <a href="http://www.kustomjoes.com">Kustom Joe's</a>
			also uses Yahoo's YUI javascript framework fairly extensively to
			manage browser history and interact with the DOM.
