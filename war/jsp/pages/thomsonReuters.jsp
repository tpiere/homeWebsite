			<a href="http://www.westlawnext.com">WestlawNext</a> is an online
			legal research service for professionals and students. Its
			predecessor, <a href="http://www.westlaw.com">Westlaw</a>, is the
			market leader for legal research. WestlawNext offers many substantial
			improvements for users such as a simplified search algorithm, folders
			for managing research, and an updated user interface.
		</p>
		<p>I primarily worked on the document display for WestlawNext. I
			was one of the first developers on the project which grew to become
			one of the largest agile projects in the nation with well over 200
			professionals building the application.</p>
		<p>I became the primary engineer for several crucial features in
			WestlawNext. I helped architect an extensive XSLT framework to
			produce the XHTML for legal documents. I lead the implementation of
			document &quot;chunking&quot; to break large documents into smaller
			parts. I also helped build the annotations feature that allows users
			to highlight sections of documents, and add notes to portions of
			documents that are relevant to their research.</p>
		<p>During the project, I gained experience with the following
			technolgies</p>

			<li>Javascript</li>
			<li>AJAX</li>
