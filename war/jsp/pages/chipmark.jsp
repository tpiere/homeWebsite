			My senior year of college, I joined a team of 11 (<a
				href="https://www.chipmark.com/Main?target=about_us_05">chipmark
				05</a>) other students to work on a bookmarks management system. The
			project has been sustained by a new group of students for the past
			few years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chipmark has a <a href="https://www.chipmark.com/Main">website</a> as
			well as plugins for Internet Explorer and Firefox. Using either of
			the plugins, or the website, users can bookmark ("chipmark") webpages
			which will be stored on the chipmark servers at the University of
			Minnesota. With bookmarks stored in one location, now users can
			access their bookmarks from any location in the world that has access
			to the the internet.
		</p>
		<p>The chipmark service is incredibly useful for me because I am
			able to use the same bookmarks from my laptop, desktop, work pc, and
			my parents' computers</p>
